<h1>
    
Lolo

</h1>
<main>
    
Waluigi had been looking forward to interviewing his next applicant. Lolo was, in many ways, an ideal candidate for a spot in <i>Big Bash Siblings.</i> It had been years since the character had seen any kind of action in a video game. His most enduring legacy now was probably his cameos in the Kirby series. How unfortunate.
<br><br>

The doorbell rang. Waluigi whistled joyfully as he made his way to the front door. He swung it wide open and was greeted by the blue, sphere-shaped adventurer.
<br><br>

"Hi," said Lolo.
<br><br>

Waluigi adopted his friendliest grin, which was still very sinister-looking. "Yes, hello. Mister Lolo, I presume? Please, come in."
<br><br>

Waluigi clasped his hands together. "I must confess, I was looking forward to your application in particular. Your background is exactly the type of thing I'm looking for."
<br><br>

"Oh, I'm flattered! But yeah, I'm looking forward to the puzzles. I love me some puzzles!"
<br><br>

<i>Huh?</i> Waluigi assumed he misheard something. "Excuse me? I didn't quite catch that."
<br><br>

"I'm looking forward to the puzzles," Lolo repeated. The two took a seat at Waluigi's dinner table.
<br><br>

Waluigi blinked. "I'm afraid I don't understand."
<br><br>

"Isn't there going to be some kind of puzzle hunt? Am I crazy?"
<br><br>

"Um..." There was an awkward pause. "I'm sorry. What made you think that you would find some kind of puzzle hunt here?"
<br><br>

"Bro!" Wario jumped out of his room. He then began to mimic the act of throwing something. After releasing it from his hand, he paused his movement, as if waiting for something to return. He then pretended that he caught whatever this object was again. He put on this display exactly one time.
<br><br>

"Did I hear someone say puzzle hunt, bro?"
<br><br>

"You sure did!" Lolo said excitedly. "I love those things! I saw the super purple website you created and was immediately interested! I can't wait to identify, sort, index, and solve puzzles! I wonder if you guys are going to have any cool Vigenere ciphers or Playfair ciphers or..."
<br><br>

Waluigi looked back and forth these two and shook his head. "What the Bullet Bill is going on? There is no puzzle hunt here! Besides, I don't think Wario even knows what a puzzle hunt is."
<br><br>

Wario chuckled. "Bro, get with the program. Everyone knows what a puzzle hunt is, bro." He folded his arms. "Yep, I sure know what a puzzle hunt is... though it would be helpful if someone, possibly this little blue bro here, could explain exactly what that term means. And also, it would be great if someone could clear up if puzzlehunt was one word or two."
<br><br>

Waluigi knew this was Wario code for "I have no idea what the heck this means."
<br><br>

Wario snorted again. "Yeah, bro. If someone doesn't explain what a puzzle quest is right now, I'm going to assume that it's where you look for a bunch of jigsaw pieces. Unless that's wrong, in which case I was just kidding and I never actually thought that in the first place. Bro." Real smooth.
<br><br>

Lolo raised a hand. "If you've never heard of puzzle hunts before, here's a very brief summary: in a typical puzzle, you receive some information and have to extract an answer out of it, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles can come..."
<br><br>

What was going on? Waluigi imagined that he was in some kind of weird fantasy world. A world where a donkey, hound, cat, and rooster could play musical instruments. Or one where girls could have extremely long hair that people can use to scale towers. Or one where witches could abduct children in a forest and live in gingerbread houses... But this was not one of those worlds.
<br><br>

"Hold on!" Waluigi slammed his fist on the table. "Let's clear up this misunderstanding right now. Ever since my failed steak venture years ago, I've sworn off puzzle hunts. But enough of that... Lolo, I was hoping to recruit you for a video game I'm working on, <i>Big Bash Siblings</i>."
<br><br>

Lolo sighed. "Oh. I guess I must've made a mistake. I thought there'd be a Waluigi-themed hunt or something." The disappointment was palpable. "But yeah, sure, whatever. I bet that hunt would've done something ridiculous like make me read a bunch of glorified fanfiction anyway."
<br><br>

"Aww, bro, c'mon!" Wario pleaded. "I wanted to hear about this, uh, puzzle search or whatever."
<br><br>

"Silence, brother!" Waluigi hissed. "Go back to your room and watch more dumb Yoshi memes or something."
<br><br>

"Oh, good idea, bro. Love me some dank memes!" And with that, Wario hopped away, making everyone's lives better.
